# Simple Blockchain written in GO
This is a really simple project about Go and Blockchains. It was developed by following the [articles](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-blockchain-in-less-than-200-lines-of-go-e296282bcffc) from [Coral Health](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth).

## Features
This runs a very minimal HTTP server which responds to two GET and POST endpoints. You can send your heartbeat in the POST, and see the blockchain in the GET.
